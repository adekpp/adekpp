# Hi there, I'm Adrian! 👋

### 👨‍💻 Full Stack Developer | Problem Solver | Tech Enthusiast

I am a passionate Full Stack Developer based in Poland, specializing in building modern, scalable, and high-performance web applications. I currently work as an independent developer, delivering robust solutions from the backend architecture to the frontend user experience.

### 🚀 About Me

- 💻 I focus heavily on the modern JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.
- 🏗️ Currently building projects using **Next.js**, **TanStack Start**, and **Node.js**.
- 🔧 I love creating clean, maintainable code and exploring new web technologies.
- ⚡ **Fun Fact:** When I'm not writing code, I'm likely spending quality time with my family (my partner of 17 years and our 4-year-old daughter) – or actively avoiding cucumbers at all costs! 🥒🚫
